# FCC Full Stack Web Development Challenges

## Overview

This project is a response to [Free Code Camp](http://freecodecamp.com/) full stack and back-end web development challenges. It starts with simple API services.

## Simple Timestamp API Service

To use this service:
- Point your browser or send a GET request to the following path on our domain: ```/api/timestamp/```.
- Alternatively you can use the form below to enter a date. This date will be appended to the path mentioned above. Most popular date formats are supported. But it is always wise to test.
- Once you push the button, we will show you the output of your query in the code block below.

The API responds with a JSON string. If the date format in the request is not valid or is not recognized, a JSON object with <code>null</code> values is returned.

## Request Header Parser

This sample API service is inteded to show the ability to read and interprete HTTP request headers.
